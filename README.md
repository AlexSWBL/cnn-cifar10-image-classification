# Image Classification with CNN on CIFAR-10 (Colab)

This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify CIFAR-10 images. It was implemented and tested in a single **Google Colab notebook**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- End-to-end implementation of a CNN using **PyTorch**
- Uses **ReLU**, **Cross Entropy Loss**, and learning rate scheduling
- Includes visualization of training/validation loss

## ðŸ“Ž File
- `cnn_cifar10_colab.ipynb`: Full project notebook, runnable in Colab

## ðŸš€ Open in Google Colab
